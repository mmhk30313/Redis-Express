##  What is Redis?

- Redis full form is Remote Directory Server. Redis is a NO-SQL in-memory remote database that offers high performance, replication, and a unique data model.

- Now when we have a brief idea of what Redis is, letâ€™s see how we can install Redis on windows 10.

- Redis was not developed for windows and thus a team of Microsoft handles the task to make it available to us.
